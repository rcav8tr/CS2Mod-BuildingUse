The infoview icons were created using the SVG editor at:  app.svgator.com

The following infoview icons started with an icon from the game (imported into the SVG editor):
Employees - ...\GameUI\Media\Game\Icons\Workers.svg
Visitors  - ...\GameUI\Media\Game\Icons\Population.svg
Storage   - ...\GameUI\Media\Game\Icons\ZoneIndustrialWarehouses.svg
Vehicles  - ...\GameUI\Media\Game\Resources\Vehicles.svg

The following infoview icons were adapated from other images:
Efficiency - Adapted from my Performance Monitor activation icon.
Processing - Adapted from svgator's library image for Refresh.

Icons were resized (if needed) from their original size to 26x26.
This seems to be the default size for infoview icons in the Icons folder.
All this mod's infoview icons are a consistent size.

After each infoview icon background was determined, then a percent sign was added on top of the icon.
The percent sign is not text.
The percent sign is constructed from two ellipses and a line.
The constructed percent sign was saved to the svgator library so the exact same percent sign could be added to each icon.
